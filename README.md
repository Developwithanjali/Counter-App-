# Counter-App
The Counter App is a simple and intuitive web application built with React.js that allows users to track and manipulate a numerical value, referred to as the "count." 
Sure! Hereâ€™s a prompt for creating a simple Counter App using React.js:


**Project Title:** Simple Counter App

**Objective:** Build a basic counter application using React.js that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value.

**Requirements:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Use Create React App to bootstrap your project.
   - Ensure you have the latest version of React.

2. **Components:**
   - Create a functional component called `Counter`.
   - Inside the `Counter` component, maintain a state variable called `count` initialized to `0`.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Implement three buttons:
     - **Increment**: Increases the `count` by 1.
     - **Decrement**: Decreases the `count` by 1 (ensure it does not go below 0).
     - **Reset**: Resets the `count` back to 0.
   - Display the current count value on the screen.

4. **Styling:**
   - Add basic styles to make the app visually appealing (consider using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution).

5. **Bonus Features (optional):**
   - Add a "double" button that doubles the current count.
   - Implement a way to change the increment/decrement value (e.g., input field).
   - Add persistent state using `localStorage` so the count remains after a page refresh.

**Deliverables:**
- A well-organized React application with functional components.
- Clean and readable code.
